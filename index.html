            Traveling has always been something I want to do more of. I like
            learning about different places, trying new food, and seeing what
            everyday life looks like in other parts of the world.
          </p>

            On this website, I collect ideas, notes, and dream itineraries for
            some of the cities I’d love to visit one day. For now, it’s a place
            to learn and imagine.

              Tokyo seems exciting because it mixes old traditions with bright,
              <br />modern city life. I want to try the food, see famous places,
              and experience how <br />busy and lively the city feels.

          Start with my first destination here:
          <a href="tokyo.html">My Tokyo Trip Page</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond these places, there are dozens of other locations on my list:
          bustling cities, quiet coastal towns, and mountain villages. As I
          learn more, I’ll keep expanding this site with notes, resources, and
          wish-lists.
